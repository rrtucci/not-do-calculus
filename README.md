Iden= Identifiability

## Code History
This repo is a superset of a previous github repo of mine:

https://github.com/rrtucci/napkin-do-calc

The main difference between this repo and the previous one
is the 2 files 

1. [identification.py](https://github.com/rrtucci/dag_iden_detector/blob/master/identification.py)

2. [adjustment_formulae.py](https://github.com/rrtucci/dag_iden_detector/blob/master/adjustment_formulae.py)

plus all the new jupyter notebooks and pics.
(see **jupyter_notebooks** folder)

The code pertaining to the data structure "Potentials" found
in this repo and in the previous one comes from my previous 
repo

## Do Calculus Background
Judea Pearl has defined 
the concept of "identifiability" for
a do-query $P(y|do(\underline{x})=x)$
with respect to a Bayesian Network that I like to 
call the Original Promise (OP). Pearl has
also given 3 rules of "Do Calculus"
which can be applied to 
the OP to decide whether a
do-query for the OP is identifiable or not.
If it is identifiable, the 3 Rules
also yield a so called "adjustment formula".

An adjustment formula is
a formula that equals $P(y|do(\underline{x})=x)$
but 

* it contains no do operators 
* it contains no probabilities
of hidden variables, even when the OP has some. 
* It can be calculated from DATA
OBTAINED WITHOUT CONDUCTING AN RCT 
(Randomized Controlled Trial).

## What this code can and cannot do
This repo contains Python
code for checking numerically on 
an OP with random CPTs (Conditional Probability Tables)
whether an adjustment formula is 
correct or not. The code cannot tell its users
whether any or how many adjustment formulae 
exist for a given OP,
nor can it derive new adjustment formulae.
What it can do is to check whether an
alledged adjustment formula is correct or not.

## Our Findings

Pearl has given adjustment formulae (AF) that
he calls the backdoor AF and frontdoor AF.
Cinelli has given an AF for the "Napkin" OP [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/514615/do-calculus-for-causal-diagram-7-5-from-the-book-of-why-napkin-problem) 


Our findings are presented in jupyter notebooks in the
**jupyter_notebooks** folder. See the 
[SUMMARY notebook](https://github.com/rrtucci/dag_iden_detector/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/SUMMARY.ipynb)
for a summary of each notebook

We show that:
* the backdoor AF is correct
* the frontdoor AF is correct
* Cinelli's AF for the napkin OP is INCORRECT (see Napkin4)
* We guess an AF for the napkin OP and show 
that it's correct (see Napkin1)

## Notation
In the jupyter notebooks, I use the notation $\sum_y\text{ num}$
in a context such as $P(y) = \frac{ e^{-y}}{\sum_y \text {num}}$
to mean a normalization constant, i.e., a sum over the 
numerator 
of a fraction, so that $\sum_y P(y)=1$.
